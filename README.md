Homework solutions to Stanford's Algorithms, Design and Analysis Part 1 coursework from Coursera

Provided here are the solutions to the aforementioned course homework. This is an exercise in both
using git and GitHub as well as algorithmic analysis. I intend to put some more formal proofing in here 
as well, but for now, it's a relatively low priority. 

If you are a current student in the class,
feel free to browse, but I urge you to find your own solutions. [See Coursera's Honor Code.](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) Additionally, see [the license.]()
